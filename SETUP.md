# Smart Time Tracker - Setup Guide

## Overview
A beautiful, modern time tracking application built with React, Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This is the frontend interface - backend integration requires Supabase connection.

## Current Features (Frontend Only)
- ✅ **Dashboard**: Overview with productivity metrics, team status, and activity charts
- ✅ **Team Management**: Team member list, status indicators, and invite interface
- ✅ **Reports & Analytics**: Time breakdowns, productivity charts, screenshot gallery, and activity logs  
- ✅ **Profile**: Personal stats, time logs, achievements, and preferences
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly with dark theme
- ✅ **Modern UI**: Glass morphism effects, gradients, and smooth animations

## Next Steps: Backend Integration

To enable full functionality (authentication, data storage, real-time features), connect your Lovable project to Supabase:

1. **Click the green Supabase button** in the top-right of your Lovable interface
2. **Connect to Supabase** to activate the integration
3. **Set up database tables** for:
   - Users and authentication
   - Time logs and tracking data  
   - Team management
   - Screenshots storage
   - Reports and analytics

## Backend API Endpoints Needed
Once Supabase is connected, implement these endpoints:

```
POST /auth/login          - User authentication
POST /auth/signup         - User registration
GET  /timelogs           - Fetch time tracking data
POST /timelogs           - Create new time entries
GET  /screenshots        - Retrieve screenshot gallery
POST /screenshots        - Upload screenshots
GET  /teams              - Team member data
POST /teams/invite       - Send team invitations
GET  /reports            - Analytics and reporting data
```

## Environment Variables
After Supabase integration, these will be auto-configured:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (for additional backend services)

## Technologies Used
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development
- **Tailwind CSS** with custom design system
- **Shadcn/UI** components
- **Lucide React** icons
- **React Query** for data fetching
- **React Router** for navigation

## Design System
- **Dark theme** with electric blue and purple gradients
- **Glass morphism** cards with subtle shadows
- **Semantic color tokens** for productivity states
- **Responsive layout** with mobile navigation

## Running the Project
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will run on `http://localhost:5173`

## Deployment
This project is optimized for deployment on:
- **Vercel** (recommended)
- **Netlify** 
- **Any static hosting service**

For full functionality, ensure your Supabase integration is properly configured before deployment.
